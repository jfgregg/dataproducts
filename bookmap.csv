The Day of the Pelican,Katherine Paterson,42.643016,20.953599,"When Meli Lleshi’s teenage brother is arrested and beaten without cause by the Serbian-run government in Kosovo, Meli’s parents decide to move out of the city and back to the family farm.

The Lleshis flee their burning homestead—one family among thousands without safe haven. Katherine Paterson chronicles the rising Serbian government crackdown and ethnic cleansing of Albanian Kosovars through the experiences of the close-knit, extended Lleshi family in this novel rivetingly grounded in Meli’s perspective.

Meli and her immediate family eventual journey from a refugee camp to the United States. It marks a hopeful new beginning, but the events of 9/11 condemn them again in some people’s eyes because of their religion. A more definitive timeframe for this story set in the late 1990s, and a bit more introductory information, would have been helpful, but a lengthy author’s note fills in some gaps essential to understanding the political context of this affecting and important story.

Light Years,Tammar Stein,31.771959,35.217018,"Maya, a twenty-year-old Israeli woman who has recently finished her service in the Israeli army, is now studying astronomy at the University of Virginia. Haunted by the recent death of her boyfriend in a pipe bombing attack in Tel Aviv, her grief is compounded by her belief that she was the intended victim, and by the fact that he was opposed to her going to school in America. Now she has come not only to study but to heal. Tammar Stein’s novel moves between Maya’s current challenges to fit into college and a new culture (which include a sexy TA and a seemingly superficial roommate) and her memories of life in Israel, where the fear of bombs and threat of war were constant.

"Black Dove, White Raven",Elizabeth Wein,9.149175,40.498867,"The alternating voices of foster siblings Emmy and Teo describe their life together in the 1920s and early 1930s, first in the United States and then in Ethiopia, where they are caught in that emerging nation’s internal and international struggles.

I am Malala,Malala Yousafzai and Patricia McCormick,35.383333,72.183333,"The young reader’s edition of Malala Yousafzai’s memoir is more focused on her own life and work than the adult volume, which talks more about her father, who ran the school Malala attended in her home in Pakistan’s SWAT Valley. Malala’s voice is both wise and authentically young as she describes her childhood in a family where girls and education both were valued; and where her two younger brothers sometimes annoyed her as siblings do. Her growing passion for speaking out in support of girls’ education was in part a direct response to the growing threat presented by conservative voices in Pakistan, including the Taliban, and both her parents were sources of inspiration — her father for his passion and commitment, her mother for her courage. Malala had been speaking out for five years before she was shot by the Taliban at age fifteen. She talks about the immediate aftermath of the shooting and what happened in the weeks and months that followed as her story became a source of both outrage and inspiration. She and her family now live in Birmingham, England, where she was taken for care following the shooting, because it is unsafe for them to return home. (This volume was published before Malala was named co-winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize.)",

Graffiti Moon,Cath Crowley,-33.865143,151.2099,"Out with friends to celebrate the end of high school, Lucy is obsessed with finding the graffiti artist known as Shadow, whose work she loves. Lucy, also an artist and headed for community college, believes she and Shadow will have an instant connection if they meet. Instead, she ends up stuck with high school dropout Ed for the night. He’s killing time with his friends Leo and Dillon until it’s late enough to break into the high school to steal computers. Ed’s friends claim Ed knows Shadow. In truth, Ed IS Shadow. He dropped out of school to help his mom pay bills, and because reading is such a struggle for him. For two years he worked at a paint store, mentored by Bert, the elderly owner. But Bert’s recent death has left Ed without a job and without hope. As he gets to know Lucy, Ed wants to tell her the truth about his identity, but anonymity is what’s given him the courage to be honest in his art. In alternating chapters from Lucy’s and Ed’s perspectives, Australian author Cath Crowley takes a lyrical, gritty, often funny look at teens on the verge of adulthood, and the ways art, creativity, and connection can provide solace, meaning, and hope. The planned robbery becomes a source of both tension and comic relief in this novel full of clever yet believable dialogue among characters it’s a pleasure to spend time with.",
